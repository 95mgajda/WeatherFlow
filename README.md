# 🌦️ WeatherFlow

**WeatherFlow** is a modular IoT-inspired data pipeline designed for collecting, processing, analyzing and forecasting weather data using Python and Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS). The project simulates weather sensor input, processes data via ETL, stores it in a SQL Server database, and builds a predictive model to forecast temperature trends. Optional dashboard integration is included.

## 🔧 Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, schedule)
- Microsoft SQL Server (via pyodbc)
- ETL pipeline structure
- Weather data (CSV or simulated)
- Regression-based temperature prediction
- Optional dashboard (Plotly / Streamlit)

## 🎯 Key features
- Clean ETL pipeline with scheduling and logging
- EDA with data visualizations
- SQL Server database integration
- SQL queries on processed data (T-SQL)
- Basic machine learning model (linear regression)
- Optional interactive dashboard

## 🚀 Goal
This project is designed as a portfolio-ready showcase for aspiring data engineers and data scientists interested in IoT, automation, and enterprise-grade database integration.
